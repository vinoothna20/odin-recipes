Built a recipes website using HTML.

I have used links to go to different recipese form the home page. 

And have also use order and unordered list tags to display the steps and ingredients required to make the recipe.

Using the figure ans img tags I have displayed the image with a short description.

Applied stylings like margins, display, font styles and hovering to home and recipe pages.
