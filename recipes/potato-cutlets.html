   <p>A mouthwatering Indian appetizer. Mildly spicy, serve hot with sweet and sour sauces, like tamarind sauce <span class="highlight">(found in the Ethnic section of most grocery stores)</span> and ketchup.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>5 medium-size potatoes, washed thoroughly</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons coriander powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons black pepper</li>
    <li>10 cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons bread crumbs</li>
    <li>oil for frying</li> 
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Place unpeeled potatoes in a large saucepan, fill with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are soft and tender. Drain, cool, and peel potatoes.</li>
    <li>Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add salt, garam masala, coriander powder, pepper, and cilantro. Mash with a large fork or potato masher until there are no lumps. Shape potatoes into flat cutlets, about 2 or 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Coat each cutlet lightly in bread crumbs, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat about 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry potato cutlets in batches until golden brown on both sides. Between batches, add oil as needed.</li>
   </ol>
